# NSwatch
Use the NS API to look for changes in your daily train routine. Especially the cancelled trains which are not (yet?) picked up by the regular NS App. The code will run from Crontab, monitor your regular trains and send you a Telegram message before you commute to a train station to find your train has been cancelled or delayed. It will run on your Raspberry.
